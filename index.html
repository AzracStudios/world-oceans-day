          <p class="content">
            World Ocean Day is an international day that takes place annually on
            8 June. The concept was originally proposed in 1992 by Canada's
            International Centre for Ocean Development and the Ocean Institute
            of Canada at the Earth Summit Conference on Environment and
            Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. "World Oceans Day" was
            officially recognized by the United Nations in 2008. The
            international day supports the implementation of worldwide
            Sustainable Development Goals and fosters public interest in the
            protection of the ocean and the sustainable management of its
            resources.

          <p class="title">Why do we celebrate it?</p>
          <p class="content">
            World Oceans Day reminds every one of the major role the oceans have
            in everyday life. They are the lungs of our Planet and a major
            source of food and medicine and a critical part of the biosphere.
            The purpose of the Day is to inform the public of the impact of
            human actions on the ocean, develop a worldwide movement of citizens
            for the ocean, and mobilize and unite the world’s population on a
            project for the sustainable management of the world's oceans.

          <p class="content">
            The ocean covers over 70% of the planet. It is our life source,
            supporting humanity’s sustenance and that of every other organism on
            earth. The ocean produces at least 50% of the planet’s oxygen, it is
            home to most of earth’s biodiversity, and is the main source of
            protein for more than a billion people around the world.
          </p>
          <p class="content">
            Not to mention, the ocean is key to our economy with an estimated 40
            million people being employed by ocean-based industries by 2030.
            Even though all its benefits, the ocean is now in need of support.
            With 90% of big fish populations depleted, and 50% of coral reefs
            destroyed, we are taking more from the ocean than can be
            replenished. To protect and preserve the ocean and all it sustains,
            we must create a new balance, rooted in true understanding of the
            ocean and how humanity relates to it. We must build a connection to
            the ocean that is inclusive, innovative, and informed by lessons
            from the past.
